A time series is a set of observations on a variable’s outcomes in different time periods: the quarterly sales for a particular company during the past five years, for example, or the daily returns on a traded security. In this reading, we explore the two chief uses of time-series models: to explain the past and to predict the future of a time series. We also discuss how to estimate time-series models, and we examine how a model describing a particular time series can change over time. The following two examples illustrate the kinds of questions we might want to ask about time series. Suppose it is the beginning of 2020 and we are managing a US-based investment portfolio that includes Swiss stocks. Because the value of this portfolio would decrease if the Swiss franc depreciates with respect to the dollar, and vice versa, holding all else constant, we are considering whether to hedge the portfolio’s exposure to changes in the value of the franc. To help us in making this decision, we decide to model the time series of the franc/dollar exchange rate. Exhibit 1 shows monthly data on the franc/dollar exchange rate. The data are monthly averages of daily exchange rates. Has the exchange rate been more stable since 1987 than it was in previous years? Has the exchange rate shown a long-term trend? How can we best use past exchange rates to predict future exchange rates? As another example, suppose it is the beginning of 2020. We cover retail stores for a sell-side firm and want to predict retail sales for the coming year. Exhibit 2 shows monthly data on US retail sales. The data are not seasonally adjusted, hence the spikes around the holiday season at the turn of each year. Because the reported sales in the stores’ financial statements are not seasonally adjusted, we model seasonally unadjusted retail sales. How can we model the trend in retail sales? How can we adjust for the extreme seasonality reflected in the peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals? How can we best use past retail sales to predict future retail sales? Some fundamental questions arise in time-series analysis: How do we model trends? How do we predict the future value of a time series based on its past values? How do we model seasonality? How do we choose among time-series models? And how do we model changes in the variance of time series over time? We address each of these issues in this reading. We first describe typical challenges in applying the linear regression model to time-series data. We present linear and log-linear trend models, which describe, respectively, the value and the natural log of the value of a time series as a linear function of time. We then present autoregressive time-series models—which explain the current value of a time series in terms of one or more lagged values of the series. Such models are among the most commonly used in investments, and the section addresses many related concepts and issues. We then turn our attention to random walks. Because such time series are not covariance stationary, they cannot be modeled using autoregressive models unless they can be transformed into stationary series. We therefore explore appropriate transformations and tests of stationarity. The subsequent sections address moving-average time-series models and discuss the problem of seasonality in time series and how to address it. We also cover autoregressive moving-average models, a more complex alternative to autoregressive models. The last two topics are modeling changing variance of the error term in a time series and the consequences of regression of one time series on another when one or both time series may not be covariance stationary.', 'Learning Outcomes': 'calculate and evaluate the predicted trend value for a time series, modeled as either\\n                     a linear trend or a log-linear trend, given the estimated trend coefficients; describe factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear trend should be used\\n                     with a particular time series and evaluate limitations of trend models; explain the requirement for a time series to be covariance stationary and describe\\n                     the significance of a series that is not stationary; describe the structure of an autoregressive (AR) model of order p and calculate one- and two-period-ahead forecasts given the estimated coefficients; explain how autocorrelations of the residuals can be used to test whether the autoregressive\\n                     model fits the time series; explain mean reversion and calculate a mean-reverting level; contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and compare the forecasting accuracy\\n                     of different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion; explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models; describe characteristics of random walk processes and contrast them to covariance\\n                     stationary processes; describe implications of unit roots for time-series analysis, explain when unit roots\\n                     are likely to occur and how to test for them, and demonstrate how a time series with\\n                     a unit root can be transformed so it can be analyzed with an AR model; describe the steps of the unit root test for nonstationarity and explain the relation\\n                     of the test to autoregressive time-series models; explain how to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model and calculate\\n                     and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a seasonal lag; explain autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe how ARCH\\n                     models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series; explain how time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration\\n                     before use in a linear regression; and determine an appropriate time-series model to analyze a given investment problem and\\n                     justify that choice.', 'Link to the Summary Page': 'https://www.cfainstitute.org/membership/professional-development/refresher-readings/time-series-analysis', 'Link to the PDF File': 'https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2024/level2/level2a/RR_2024_L2V1R5_time_series_analysis.pdf'}\n"
